# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
Attacks and defenses against traffic sign recognition with existed gradient-based and optimization-based approaches.

Traffic Sign Recognition is one of the most important and indispensable parts in advanced intelligent transportation system and self-driving car engineering, which is also a domestic and international research topic in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. With the development of Depth Learning, the traffic sign recognition method based on deep-layer Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can autonomously learn the deep-seated features within the image from the training samples, in order to improve the accuracy of recognition. However, the deep-layer CNN is vulnerable to transferable adversarial examples: malicious traffic sign images produced by a specific model are modified to yield erroneous other modelsâ€™ outputs, disrupting the vehicle driving behavior while appearing unmodified to human observers. The greater challenge is proposed for the accuracy, robustness and security of traffic sign auto-recognition. 

The following steps should be sufficient to get these attacks up and running on
most Linux-based systems.

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo pip3 install pillow scipy numpy tensorflow-gpu keras h5py

# Run the Code
