        The L_infinity optimized attack.
        Returns adversarial examples for the supplied model.
        targeted: True if we should perform a targetted attack, False otherwise.
        learning_rate: The learning rate for the attack algorithm. Smaller values
          produce better results but are slower to converge.
        max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations. Larger values are more
          accurate; setting too small will require a large learning rate and will
          produce poor results.
        abort_early: If true, allows early aborts if gradient descent gets stuck.
        initial_const: The initial tradeoff-constant to use to tune the relative
          importance of distance and confidence. Should be set to a very small
          value (but positive).
        largest_const: The largest constant to use until we report failure. Should
          be set to a very large value.
        reduce_const: If true, after each successful attack, make const smaller.
        decrease_factor: Rate at which we should decrease tau, less than one.
          Larger produces better quality results.
        const_factor: The rate at which we should increase the constant, when the
          previous constant failed. Should be greater than one, smaller is better.
